     <p>The Magical  sea turtles. 
     </p>
       
     <p> Sea turtles since the dawn of time have roamed the  oceans for over 110 Million Years since the age of dinosaurs before and after their demise. Many animals have not survived the incident but sea turtles survived. The one flaw with sea turtles is  that they are not the most logical beings, often confusing items that they shouldn't be consuming  or doing . These dumb creatures eat plastic bags mistaking them for one of their favorite treats the jelly fish. Now how do you confuse plastic bags for jelly fish? I am not sure but they are silly turtles. The silly sea turtles are not the only dumb ocean animal eating bags and other dumb plastics. Many 
      creatures are killing themselves for not being able to identify plastics and they just eat them hurting their poor stomachs but thats from their own stupidity. 

     <p>These creatures infuriate me with their stupidity and the  solution is simple. The solution I propose is to  murder these animals,exterminate their stupidity and use their unique resources for our benefit of the world. There are millions of ocean animals that could be used for their resources and food. The possibilities of what sea animals can be used for are endless. Clothing could be more diverse and unique by using these creatures unique skin, bones and overall structure. The most ultra benefit is food because sea animals pack so much protein and are good for you. The downsides of sea animals are  creating positives outcomes  out of them  by using them to our desires.Changing the problem you must deal the biggest problem within it which is handling it and dealing with it.</p>
        
     <p>The talk about plastic is always being talked about but what about where  it came from and what is the  benefits of plastic .A little bit of facts about plastic is that they are synthetic polymers , which are a material that do not contain nature materials and molded into to a shape for whatever it's going to be used for. In 1907 Leo Baekeland invented "Bakelite, the first fully synthetic plastic, meaning it contained no molecules found in nature"([3] Joseph L. Nicholson and George R. Leighton, “Plastics Come of Age,” Harper's Magazine, August 1942, p. 306.). The major discovery created a huge advancement in creativity and development of plastic because the possibilities were endless for what it could be used for. plastics became critical to modern life. Plastics made it possible for the development of computers, cell phones, and most of the lifesaving advances of modern medicine. Lightweight and good for insulation, plastics help save fossil fuels used in heating and in transportation. Perhaps most important, inexpensive plastics raised the standard of living and made material abundance more readily available. The wonderful discovery of plastic almost sounds too good to be true because it seems so perfect. <p>
      
     <!--use many evidences very important -->
     
     <p> The wonderful plastic that sounds   too good to be true like most things in life is too good to be true.While so many plastics products are disposable,  plastic lasts forever in the environment. Something that last forever in the environment means it takes a long time to decompose or does not decompose at all making it problem when there is a large abundance of plastic. Imagine the damage it has done to the ocean. The  5 major ocean gyres worldwide, In the Pacific Ocean, the North Pacific Gyre is home to the “[2]Great Pacific Garbage Patch”, a large area that is approximately the size of Texas with debris extending 20 feet (6 meters) down into the water column. It's estimated that this plastic island contains 3.5 million tons of trash and could double in size in the next 5 years".
      </p> 


       <p>  The downside of the dumb proposal is it even being suggested to deal with the current issues marine life is going through. Innocent animals with no self knowledge of knowing what is best for him and the only thing these poor creatures know such as the sea turtle know is to just tp survive. Surviving and reproducing so they can keep their pack alive and being destroyed by a resource that were meant for good is a disheartening thing to  worry to  about.
        The ocean is a odd and mysterious place even though  "[4]The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages those animals and plants listed that are found on land and in freshwater, and 137 marine species are managed by NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).". Species that spend only part of their life cycle in the ocean, like salmon and sea turtles, are managed by both! Although marine species only make up around four percent of the the total species on the endangered species list, that doesn't mean that most are doing fine. The ocean can be a difficult place to study and data about the animals there may be lacking.
        Plastic has  many ecosystems that could no longer recover no matter what we do to try and help. Destroying ecosystems was not the only thing that damaged marine life in addition "[2]Thousands of sea turtles, whales, and other marine mammals, and more than 1 million seabirds die each year from ocean pollution and ingestion or entanglement in marine debris."(SEE Turtles became  a independent 501c3 non-profit based in Portland, Oregon.).
        The only way to save these precious turtles and other marine life is come up with different solutions to handle the current problems because we need to be held accountable for our actions. What we can do is Recycle more and more, stop  dumbing in the ocean , and clean up our mistake is the only way to the fix the damage before it is too late where we live a life without any marine animals.  </p>
